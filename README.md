# Murex module: open-image

This _murex_ module creates a data type for images (`image`) and creates an
open handler which renders those images in the terminal.

It also creates a `config` option to select which terminal rendering method to
use, however it defaults to "auto" where _murex_ will attempt to auto-detect
the best method supported by your terminal emulator.

To install this run the following command in your _murex_ shell:
```
 murex-package: install https://github.com/lmorg/murex-module-open-image.git
```
